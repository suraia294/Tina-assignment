Circuit Analysis:
The BC548 is configured in a common-emitter arrangement.
The capacitors (C1 and C2) are likely used for coupling and bypassing.
Resistors in the circuit set up the proper biasing for the transistor to operate in its active region.
The output is taken from the collector, which is a common setup in amplification circuits.

Waveform Analysis:
Input Signal: The waveform at the input shows a sinusoidal signal, which appears clean and stable.
Output Signal: The output waveform shows an amplified signal with some possible distortion, which might be due to the transistor nearing saturation or cutoff regions or a mismatch in impedance.

Observations:
If the output is distorted or clipped, you may need to adjust the biasing resistors or check the transistor's operating point.
The output amplitude suggests the gain of the amplifier is functional but could be fine-tuned for better fidelity or specific applications.
